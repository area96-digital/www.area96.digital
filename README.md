# Area96 Digital's Main Website

This is the main website for Area96 Digital. It is built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), a React framework for building static and dynamic websites. The website is hosted on [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/).

## Development

We use [dev containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) to ensure that everyone is using the same development environment. To get started, follow these steps:

1. Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) on your machine.
2. Install the [Remote - Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) extension for Visual Studio Code.
3. Clone this repository.
4. Open the repository in Visual Studio Code.
5. Select "Reopen in Container" when prompted by Visual Studio Code.

This will open the repository in a development container with all the necessary tools and dependencies installed.
